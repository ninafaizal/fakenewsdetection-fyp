## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning**: CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- 📊 **LIME Explanations**: Understand why the model made a prediction
- 🌐 **Web App**: Built with Flask + HTML/CSS
- 🧪 **Interactive Testing**: Upload text or paste news to test
- 💾 **Model + Tokenizer Saved**: Easily load & reuse
- 📉 **Performance Evaluation**: Classification report & accuracy metrics
